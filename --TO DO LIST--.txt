=====QUICK TO DO=====

=====TO DO=====
-- make sure all textures are alpha-converted to 8p
-- create custom bushes or similar stuff
-- scenery stuff season-specific
-- season-specific spells: blizzard, something, wildfire, meteor
-- smarter shaman ai, including them lightning enemy shamans around, swarming towers with fws, tornading bldgs, eqing and fsing etc. (NEARLY DONE)
-- smarter shaman ai, including them dodging enemy lightnings, blast tricking and saving from drowning using lbs. (NEARLY DONE)

=====ISSUES=====
Beta specific issues:
-- Language replacement does not work with /mod command unless you put it inside "Language" folder outside of Mods folder, which isn't how it supposed to work.
-- Computer player does not clear it's script from memory, causing the code to persist in case other level doesn't have a valid script file
-- set_player_name() for online does put square brackets around name.

=====EASTER EGGS=====
-- 1 mouse message on some object per level (with new build release we should make it send a packet to other players indicating that N player found it)
